Q: How much does it cost to cool a skyscraper in the summer?
A: A lot! And not just in dollars, but in environmental impact.

In this competition, we developed accurate models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters. The data came from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe. With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies. We worked on this kaggle competition for our database management project. 

1.	Databricks Archive (DBC): You will only need to upload the building_metadata.csv to use this file on Databricks
2.	Python / Colab (IPYNB): If you run this code on Python, ignore the first two cells as they are Colab specific
3. Link to the Dataset is as follows: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/data
